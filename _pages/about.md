I am a second year PhD student at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) working under the supervision of [Elisabeth Gassiat](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~elisabeth.gassiat/) and [Zacharie Naulet](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~zacharie.naulet/) at [Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/). 
(https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Research interests
======
I have been working on topics related to inference on dependent data, mainly Hidden Markov Models and preferential attachement random graphs. I am interested in understanding the added value of dependence with respect to the usual i.i.d. setting. I also have a broad interest in nonparametric statistics, deep learning and sequential learning.
