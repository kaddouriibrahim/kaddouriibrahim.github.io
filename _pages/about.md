I am a second year PhD student at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) working under the supervision of [Elisabeth Gassiat](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~elisabeth.gassiat/) and [Zacharie Naulet](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~zacharie.naulet/) at [Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/). 

Research interests
======
I have been working on topics related to inference on dependent data, mainly Hidden Markov Models and preferential attachement random graphs. I am interested in understanding the added value of dependence with respect to the usual i.i.d. setting. I also have a broad interest in nonparametric statistics, deep learning and sequential learning.
