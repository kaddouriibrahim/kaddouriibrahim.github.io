I am a third year PhD student at [Université Paris-Saclay](https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/) working under the supervision of [Elisabeth Gassiat](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~elisabeth.gassiat/) and [Zacharie Naulet](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/~zacharie.naulet/) at [Laboratoire de Mathématiques d'Orsay](https://www.imo.universite-paris-saclay.fr/fr/). I have been working on topics related to inference on dependent data, mainly Hidden Markov Models and preferential attachement random graphs. More precisely, I seek to understand the problem of clustering when the observations come from a Hidden Markov Models and how it differs from the usual i.i.d. case , and on the other hand, I study the fundamental limits of detection and localization of change-points in preferential attachment random graphs.

Main Research Interests
======
Hidden Markov Models, random graphs, nonparametric and high dimensional statistics, statistical learning theory, sequential learning, deep learning,...
